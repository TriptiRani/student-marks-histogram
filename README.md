# 📊 Student Marks Histogram

A simple **Data Visualization Project** built with Python that analyzes the distribution of student marks and provides meaningful insights using histograms, bar charts, and summary statistics.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Understanding the distribution of student marks in a class is essential for:
- Evaluating performance  
- Identifying learning gaps  
- Recognizing achievement patterns  

Raw marks alone do not provide insights unless they are grouped and visualized meaningfully.

---

## 🛠️ Solution Approach
This project uses **Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib)** to:
- Load and clean student marks data  
- Visualize marks distribution using histograms  
- Compare subject-wise performance  
- Show pass/fail distribution using bar charts  
- Generate **summary statistics & insights**

---

## 📂 Project Structure


## 📊 Key Insights
- Overall average and median marks calculated  
- Pass rate identified (threshold = 40)  
- Best and worst performing subjects highlighted  
- Cluster of students in **70–90 marks range** observed
