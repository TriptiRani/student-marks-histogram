# ðŸ“Š Student Marks Histogram

## 1. Introduction
This project is based on **data visualization of student marks**.  
The main purpose of this project is to understand how student marks are distributed in a class and to identify performance patterns.  
By using histograms and bar charts, we can easily evaluate the overall performance and highlight learning gaps.

## 2. Problem Statement
Raw student marks do not give much information on their own.  
Teachers and educators need to see the **distribution of marks** to understand:
- How many students are performing well  
- How many students are below average  
- Which subjects are strong or weak  

---

## 3. Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
1. To analyze the distribution of marks using histograms  
2. To compare subject-wise performance  
3. To calculate pass/fail percentage of students  
4. To summarize the overall class performance with insights

## 4. Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - pandas (for data handling)  
  - numpy (for calculations)  
  - matplotlib (for visualizations)

## 5. Methodology
1. Student marks data was collected in a CSV file.  
2. The data was processed using Python libraries.  
3. Histograms were plotted to show the distribution of marks in each subject and overall.  
4. A bar chart was created to show the **pass vs fail comparison**.  
5. Summary statistics (average, median, highest, lowest) were calculated.  
6. A text file containing **insights** was generated.

---

## 6. Results
- **Histograms** showed how marks are spread across students.  
- A **Pass/Fail bar chart** clearly indicated the percentage of students passing the exam.  
- Subject-wise histograms highlighted the strongest and weakest subjects.  
- Summary statistics helped in identifying overall class performance.  

---

## 7. Key Insights
- Most students scored between **70â€“90 marks**.  
- The **pass rate** was clearly identified with a threshold of 40 marks.  
- One subject had higher average marks, while another subject showed more failures.  
- The overall distribution helped in detecting learning gaps.  

---

## 8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how simple data visualization can provide meaningful insights into student performance.  
It helps teachers to:
- Identify weak areas of students  
- Recognize high achievers  
- Plan better teaching strategies for improvement
